Enjoy!\\n\\nHiya, Streamlit users! üëã\\n\\nI\\'m Nate, co-founder of Mito‚Äîa spreadsheet that helps analysts transition from Excel to Python. I\\'ve been working on Mito for almost four years now (oof). For the past two years, our open-source community and enterprise clients have been asking us to bring Mito to Streamlit. Here is why.\\n\\nWhy Mito?\\n\\nStreamlit apps that let users upload unstructured data often encounter issues because users upload data in many different formats.\\n\\nThe typical solution is for the users to upload a file of their choosing and for the app creator to provide a variety of st.text_input , st.selectbox , and st.button that let them:\\n\\nRename, move, and delete columns Change the types of columns Filter null and other unwanted values And much more\\n\\nThis leads to apps with many inputs and strict requirements for user-provided data, effectively drowning users in basic data cleaning and transformation options.\\n\\nIt\\'s not easy to provide enough configuration options for the data formats that users bring to the table. Users often get stuck configuring a single additional parameter (e.g., how many rows to skip before the header row). As a result, they can\\'t use the app you worked so hard to create.\\n\\nCheck out this sample app to try Mito\\'s flexible data importing, cleaning, preprocessing tools, and importing methods, including:\\n\\nImporting CSV/Excel files, including advanced configuration options Renaming, reordering, and removing columns in place Filtering in a classic interface with many filter conditions Writing spreadsheet formulas to transform your data\\n\\nMito provides data cleaning options beyond your basic data importing. Here are a few examples.\\n\\nTab renaming\\n\\nNeed to rename columns to match the expected format? Rename the tabs directly in a spreadsheet:\\n\\nColumn filtering\\n\\nWant to run the rest of your app on a subset of your data? Use a spreadsheet to filter out the data you need:\\n\\nFormula writing\\n\\nNeed to let users transform columns in a more complex way? Let them write formulas as they do in Excel:\\n\\nWith Mito, users can import a dataset of their choice into your app and format it as your app requires.\\n\\nUse case 1: Mito internal Streamlit app\\n\\nAt Mito, we use an internal Streamlit app to monitor the current state of our company. It displays our current revenue, expenses, customer information, the number of blog posts from the previous week, and other relevant data. You can select variables to compare, contrast, regress, and more‚Äîto understand how Mito performs over time.\\n\\nNOTE: Making our internal app was a breeze. Streamlit can be the easiest way to explore datasets of varying complexity. Check out this fantastic app example which provides helpful, pre-configured views for gaining insight from data and graphs.\\n\\nAs the app\\'s creator, I wanted my team members to be able to compare the number of sales we made this month with the number of sales from the previous month. So I created the following input:\\n\\nmin_date, max_date = st.date_input(\\'Compare within Range\\', value=(one_week_ago, today))\\n\\nThis method is great for comparing date ranges but can\\'t answer ad-hoc questions like \"How has the number of motorcycles we\\'ve sold per month changed?\" To answer questions like that, you can use Mito\\'s pivot table feature (you can also write formulas and generate graphs right within your Streamlit app):\\n\\nUse case 2: Python script without coding\\n\\nAt Mito, we work with financial institutions that have thousands of users poring over spreadsheets and running multiple spreadsheet processes. Those spreadsheets can have hundreds of tabs and thousands of formulas. And if the person responsible for the spreadsheet leaves, it can take weeks or even months for someone else to audit and use it.\\n\\nSo, what can you do?\\n\\nOne option is to train your spreadsheet users to learn Python. But not everyone wants to do that.\\n\\nprint(\"hello world, I don\\'t think I love programming...\")\\n\\nAnother option is to use Mito! Mito enables non-programmers to write Python code without ever needing to see it. Every spreadsheet edit generates the corresponding code in the backend (a full script is created to codify the process).\\n\\nTry this sample app to see how it works (here is the code for it):\\n\\nUse case 3: Mito in any Streamlit app\\n\\nUsing Mito is super simple.\\n\\nJust install the Mito package with pip install mitosheet :\\n\\n# In a terminal pip install mitosheet\\n\\n# In your Streamlit app from mitosheet.streamlit.v1 import spreadsheet ... spreadsheet(df)\\n\\nNext, display any dataframes inside the spreadsheet component:\\n\\nimport pandas as pd import streamlit as st from mitosheet.streamlit.v1 import spreadsheet # Create a dataframe with pandas (you can pass any pandas dataframe) dataframe = pd.DataFrame({\\'A\\': [1, 2, 3]}) # Display the dataframe in a Mito spreadsheet final_dfs, code = spreadsheet(dataframe) # Display the final dataframes created by editing the Mito component # This is a dictionary from dataframe name -> dataframe st.write(final_dfs) # Display the code that corresponds to the script st.code(code)\\n\\nAnd you\\'re done!\\n\\nWrapping up\\n\\nMito has been four years in the making, and we\\'re excited to finally share it with you! Over the coming weeks, we\\'ll be improving our Streamlit support, including the additional functionality within the spreadsheet, the ability to set predefined views, and more configuration options.\\n\\nAs we roll out more features, we\\'d love to hear your feedback. Please open an issue on GitHub or leave us comments below.\\n\\nHappy app-building! üßë\\u200düíª'], ['https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/m0bj5g/mito_write_python_10x_faster_by_editing_a/', {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 1.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, 'The official Python community for Reddit!

However, it presents a critical and honest appraisal of the library and its performances.\\n\\nWhat is Mito?\\n\\nMito is an open-source python library that combines the intuitive and visual aspects of spreadsheets with the benefits of programming to handle larger datasets, provide timely elaborations and create repeatable processes easily.\\n\\nIn brief, Mito is a Jupyter Lab interface that allows users to handle data as in a spreadsheet while automatically generating the corresponding python code in the cell below.\\n\\nWho‚Äôs for?\\n\\nMito is just the perfect tool for old-school spreadsheet users ‚Äì e.g. Excel practitioners -in transition to a programming-oriented paradigm.\\n\\nHowever, I would recommend Mito also to python programmers like me that get bored by copy-pasting the same boilerplate code for exploratory data analysis. I believe this is a convenient tool for exploratory data analysis, and a good starting point to quickly set up the bulk of the code and then apply some custom adjustments here and there.\\n\\nInstallation\\n\\nThe installation is pretty simple and requires just a few steps well described in the documentation, e.g. for conda:\\n\\n# this article uses mitosheet version \\'0.1.392\\' conda create -n mitoenv python=3.8 conda activate mitoenv python -m pip install mitoinstaller python -m mitoinstaller install\\n\\nI had a try on my ubuntu 20.04 platform and managed to succeed almost without a blink.

A sound thumbs-up for this util!\\n\\nRate: 5 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nFilter and sort\\n\\nFiltering and sorting are also very common operations when dealing with data. Mito allows filtering both based on conditions and by directly excluding unwanted values.\\n\\nFiltering. Image by the author\\n\\nSorting is also effective, although ordering based on multiple columns is not natively supported. A possible workaround is to concatenate such variables and sort by the resulting column.\\n\\nRate: 4 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nFormatting\\n\\nNice data formatting is key for visual exploration. Mito provides plenty of options to arrange their content for any need.\\n\\nData formatting. Image by the author\\n\\nRate: 5 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nData types\\n\\nHandling data types is often needed during pre-processing in order to prepare the data appropriately for the following analysis pipeline. Mito does a nice job also in this respect, balancing the initial lack of customization during data import.\\n\\nData types. Image by the author\\n\\nApart from standard data types like int , float , str and bool , I tested Mito against one of the biggest data scientists‚Äô nightmares: dates. The conversion from string to datetime is seamless, and you can play around with Excel formulas for more customization. Nicely done!\\n\\nRate: 5 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nData manipulation\\n\\nMito supports several kinds of data manipulation exploiting the most used Excel formulas. Adding and deleting columns, as well as editing single cells or entire variables are just a few clicks away.\\n\\nData manipulation. Image by the author\\n\\nI really appreciated the nice interface with suggestions as you type commands, plus the Search Functionality box in the top-right corner.\\n\\nHowever, I didn‚Äôt manage to replicate one of Excel‚Äôs killer features: dragging formulas. That‚Äôs a pity and I think it should be one of the top priorities for future developments.\\n\\nAlso, added columns are not editable cell-wise ‚Äì which means you can just edit new columns as a bulk. Again, this misses out on the convenience of Excel.\\n\\nRate: 3 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nMerge\\n\\nMito supports multiple options for merging sheets, including left/right/inner/outer joins, and lookups, all nicely explained in the drop-down menu.\\n\\nMerge. Image by the author\\n\\nAnother great feature is the ability to quickly select the key variable and the columns to keep from each table. I really enjoyed that!\\n\\nOn the downsides, multi-key merges are not natively supported. However, the documentation covers this use case:\\n\\nIf you want to use multiple columns as the merge key, try creating a new column and using the CONCAT function to combine all of the columns into one. Then, select that new column as the merge key!\\n\\nAlso, I didn‚Äôt manage to merge two sheets vertically ‚Äì analogous of pandas .concat() -, for which an external pass is needed.\\n\\nRate: 4 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nDedup\\n\\nThis is one of the things I always have to google when I need it. De-duplicate repeated rows with Mito is just a couple of clicks. It supports the combination of multiple columns and provides different options for the values to keep: first, last, none.\\n\\nDedup. Image by the author\\n\\nRate: 5 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nGraphs\\n\\nThis is probably one of the top features I would look for in a tool like this. Mito does a nice job with this functionality and supports a wide choice of plot types including bar charts, line trends, boxplots and violin plots, heatmaps and more.\\n\\nLine charts. Image by the author\\n\\nDistribution charts. Image by the author\\n\\nThe flow through the interface is very smooth and the results are decent, with a bonus for the use of plotly for interactive charts. Unfortunately, it is not possible to alter their appearance but that‚Äôs not a great concern for explorative analysis. Plus, the generated code can be leveraged as a basis for quick adaptations to the desired looks.\\n\\nBut does Mito have the WOW-factor?\\n\\nUnivariate graphs are nice and functional, definitely a strong thumbs up!\\n\\nThe result is a bit less effective for multivariate plots though. Mito handles some functionalities but fails to represent the same information by groups.\\n\\nBoxplot by multiple groups. Image by the author\\n\\nIn the above example, the auto-generated code simply concatenates the values in the X-axis which is somewhat not intuitive in my opinion:\\n\\nI think a better way to handle this would be adding the second x-variable as the color argument instead:\\n\\nOverall, a great solution for quick exploration that works in most of the common use cases. For more articulate needs and styling there‚Äôs some room for improvement.\\n\\nRate: 4 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nPivot table\\n\\nPivot tables are a way to summarize findings by means of aggregate statistics. Mito allows doing this very smoothly in an Excel-like fashion.\\n\\nPivot table. Image by the author\\n\\nThe interface is really intuitive and supports all the aggregation functions you can think of. The formatting utils can then be used to better visualize the results or refine the output for later export and sharing.\\n\\nAdding a choice on how to handle missing values would be a nice add-on for future developments.\\n\\nRate: 5 / 5 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\\n\\nPhoto by Sherman Yang on Unsplash\\n\\nFinal thoughts\\n\\nAll in all Mito is a mature tool and does a great job, enabling the users to inspect the data visually and interact with them intuitively and efficiently. It covers pretty much all of the most common use cases for exploratory data analysis like checking values and distributions, editing and formatting data, merging sheets, creating pivot tables, and various kinds of plotting. All the operations are tracked and automatically converted to Python code that performs the actions on the underlying pandas dataframes.\\n\\nI appreciated the order of the generated code and the fact it contains comments to guide the users through it. Also, it is well optimized to exploit fast pandas implementations ‚Äì e.g. it uses .at() instead of .loc() to set the value of a cell efficiently as per pandas documentation.\\n\\nAlso, a bonus goes for the easy installation, the spot and comprehensive documentation ‚Äì which I found helpful while exploring the library ‚Äì and the availability of a Discord channel for assistance ‚Äì I got a reply even during the weekend!\\n\\nIn terms of limitations, I encountered two major missing features: the Excel-fashion formula dragging and the possibility to edit created columns cell-wise ‚Äì instead of column-wise.\\n\\nAs further extensions or enrichment, I would love the possibility to merge sheets on multiple keys straight away rather than creating a concatenated key right for the purpose. Also, it would be nice to have an automatic refresh of graphs or pivot tables after filtering. Finally, multivariate plots are still incomplete. I think their enhancement may be the missing piece to finalize the tool for end-to-end data exploration within Mito.\\n\\nResources\\n\\nTo give it a try, here are some link to more resources:\\n\\nWebsite: https://www.trymito.io/ YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9o_0m1fwCjigfIpnKr0oA/featured Github: https://github.com/mito-ds/monorepo\\n\\nThat‚Äôs all for this time!

It requires Python 3.6 and above version. Also, Nodejs, which is a JavaScript runtime environment should be installed on your system.\\n\\nI want to mention that you should install this package in a separate environment (virtual environment) to avoid any dependency error. Let‚Äôs go through the installation steps (run these commands in the terminal).\\n\\n1. Create an environment\\n\\nI am using Conda to create a new environment. You can also use Python‚Äôs ‚Äúvenv‚Äù for creating virtual environments.\\n\\nconda create -n mitoenv python=3.8\\n\\n2. Activate the environment\\n\\nconda activate mitoenv\\n\\n3. Install Mito via pip\\n\\npip install mitoinstaller\\n\\n4. Run the Mito installer\\n\\npython -m mitoinstaller install\\n\\nThis process will take a while to install and set up the Mito.\\n\\n5. Start the Jupyter lab\\n\\njupyter lab\\n\\nA quick fix\\n\\nWhen you start the Jupyter lab, you may get this type of error:\\n\\n. . .

I would be happy to assist.\\n\\nMitoSheets Interface\\n\\nIn the Jupyter lab, create a new notebook and initialize the Mitosheet:\\n\\nimport mitosheet mitosheet.sheet()\\n\\nFor the first time, you will be prompted to enter your email address for signup:\\n\\nFirst-time setup screen (Screenshot from notebook)\\n\\nAfter filling up the basics, you will be redirected to the GUI spreadsheet. Let‚Äôs discover all the features of this interface and discuss how the changes are converted to Python equivalent code.\\n\\nLoading the Dataset\\n\\nTo load a dataset in MitoSheets, simply click on Import. Then you will have two options:\\n\\nAdd a file from the current folder: This will list all the CSV files in the current directory and you will be able to select them from the dropdown menu. Add the file by the path of the file: This will add only that particular file.\\n\\nSee this in action:\\n\\nIf you look at the cell below this, you will find out that the Python equivalent code to import a dataset using Pandas has been generated with proper comments!\\n\\nThis is the power of Mito, every action you take in your Mitosheet will be converted to Python equivalent code! Let‚Äôs explore all the features of Mito in detail.\\n\\nAdding and Deleting Columns\\n\\nJust like in excel and spreadsheets, you can add a new column that might be created from the existing columns or features. To perform this action in Mito, simply click on the ‚ÄúAdd Col‚Äù button. The column will be added next to the currently selected column. Initially, the column name will be an alphabet and all the values of the column will be zero.\\n\\nTo edit the contents of this new column,\\n\\nClick on the new column name (The allotted alphabet) A sidebar menu will pop up where you can edit the name of the column. To update the contents of the column, click on any cell of this column, and assign the value. You can either assign a constant value or create values out of the existing features of the dataset. For creating values from existing columns, directly call the column name with operators to be performed. The data type of the new column is changed according to the value assigned.\\n\\nThe GIF below describes all the things mentioned above:\\n\\nSimilarly, to delete any column,\\n\\nSelect any column by clicking on it. Click on ‚ÄúDel Col‚Äù and that particular column will be deleted from the dataset.\\n\\nThe Python equivalent code with proper comments is generated in the next cell for the actions performed is:\\n\\n# MITO CODE START (DO NOT EDIT) from mitosheet import * # Import necessary functions from Mito register_analysis(\\'UUID-7bf77d26-84f4-48ed-b389-3f7a3b729753\\') # Let Mito know which analysis is being run # Imported edxCourses.csv import pandas as pd edxCourses_csv = pd.read_csv(\\'edxCourses.csv\\') # Added column H to edxCourses_csv edxCourses_csv.insert(7, \\'H\\', 0) # Renamed H to newCol in edxCourses_csv edxCourses_csv.rename(columns={\"H\": \"newCol\"}, inplace=True) # Set newCol in edxCourses_csv to =coursePrice + courseEnrollments edxCourses_csv[\\'newCol\\'] = edxCourses_csv[\\'coursePrice\\'] + edxCourses_csv[\\'courseEnrollments\\'] # Deleted column newCol from edxCourses_csv edxCourses_csv.drop(\\'newCol\\', axis=1, inplace=True) # MITO CODE END (DO NOT EDIT)\\n\\nCreate Pivot Tables\\n\\nA pivot table is an important excel function that summarizes the numeric variables based on one more categorical feature. To create such a table using Mito,\\n\\nClick on ‚ÄúPivot‚Äù and select the source dataset (by default the CSV loaded) Select the rows, columns, and value column for the pivot table. You can also select the aggregation function for the values column. All the options such as sum, mean, median, min, max, count, and standard deviation are available. After selecting all the necessary fields, you will get a separate table containing the Pivot table implementation.\\n\\nThe GIF below demonstrates how to create a Pivot table for the ‚Äúmean‚Äù aggregation function:\\n\\nGenerated Python code for this:\\n\\n# MITO CODE START (DO NOT EDIT) from mitosheet import * # Import necessary functions from Mito register_analysis(\\'UUID-a35246c0-e0dc-436b-8667-076d4f08e0c1\\') # Let Mito know which analysis is being run # Imported edxCourses.csv import pandas as pd edxCourses_csv = pd.read_csv(\\'edxCourses.csv\\') # Pivoted edxCourses_csv into df2 pivot_table = edxCourses_csv.pivot_table( index=[\\'courseOrganization\\'], values=[\\'coursePrice\\'], aggfunc={\\'coursePrice\\': \\'mean\\'} ) # Reset the column name and the indexes df2 = pivot_table.rename_axis(None, axis=1).reset_index() # MITO CODE END (DO NOT EDIT)\\n\\nMerging Two Datasets\\n\\nMerging datasets is an essential part of data science projects. Generally, the datasets are divided among various tables so as to increase the accessibility and readability of information. Merging in Mitosheets is easy.\\n\\nClick on ‚ÄúMerge‚Äù and select the data sources. You need to specify the keys to which this merger should be done. You can also select the columns from the data sources to be retained after the merger. By default, all the columns will be retained in the merged dataset.\\n\\nPython Equivalent:\\n\\n# MITO CODE START (DO NOT EDIT) from mitosheet import * # Import necessary functions from Mito register_analysis(\\'UUID-88ac4a92-062f-4ed8-a55d-729394975740\\') # Let Mito know which analysis is being run # Imported Airport-Pets.csv, Zipcode-Data.csv import pandas as pd Airport_Pets_csv = pd.read_csv(\\'Airport-Pets.csv\\') Zipcode_Data_csv = pd.read_csv(\\'Zipcode-Data.csv\\') # Merged Airport_Pets_csv and Zipcode_Data_csv temp_df = Zipcode_Data_csv.drop_duplicates(subset=\\'Zip\\') Airport_Pets_csv_tmp = Airport_Pets_csv.drop([\\'State\\', \\'Division\\'], axis=1) Zipcode_Data_csv_tmp = temp_df.drop([\\'Mean_Income\\', \\'Pop\\'], axis=1) df3 = Airport_Pets_csv_tmp.merge(Zipcode_Data_csv_tmp, left_on=[\\'Zip\\'], right_on=[\\'Zip\\'], how=\\'left\\', suffixes=[\\'_Airport_Pets_csv\\', \\'_Zipcode_Data_csv\\']) # MITO CODE END (DO NOT EDIT)\\n\\nModifying Column Data types, sorting and filtering\\n\\nYou can change the existing columns data types, sort columns in ascending or descending order, or filter them via boundary conditions. The process to implement these steps in Mito is easy and can be done via the GUI itself by selecting the onscreen options.\\n\\nClick on the desired column You will be presented with a list of data types. You can choose any datatype from the dropdown according to your requirement and that data type will be applied to the whole column. Next, you can sort the data in ascending or descending order by selecting the provided choices. You can also filter your data with custom filters.\\n\\nPython code:\\n\\n# MITO CODE START (DO NOT EDIT) from mitosheet import * # Import necessary functions from Mito register_analysis(\\'UUID-cc414267-d9aa-4017-8890-ee3b7461c15b\\') # Let Mito know which analysis is being run # Imported edxCourses.csv import pandas as pd edxCourses_csv = pd.read_csv(\\'edxCourses.csv\\') # Changed coursePrice from int64 to float edxCourses_csv[\\'coursePrice\\'] = edxCourses_csv[\\'coursePrice\\'].astype(\\'float\\') # Sorted coursePrice in edxCourses_csv in descending order edxCourses_csv = edxCourses_csv.sort_values(by=\\'coursePrice\\', ascending=False, na_position=\\'first\\') edxCourses_csv = edxCourses_csv.reset_index(drop=True) # Filtered coursePrice in edxCourses_csv edxCourses_csv = edxCourses_csv[edxCourses_csv[\\'coursePrice\\'] >= 500] edxCourses_csv = edxCourses_csv.reset_index(drop=True) # MITO CODE END (DO NOT EDIT)\\n\\nGraphs and Stats Generation\\n\\nYou can also generate graphs right in this extension without coding the plotting logic. By default, all the plots generated by this extension are made using Plotly. That means that plots are interactive and can be modified on the fly. One thing I noticed is that the code for graphs is not present in the next cell (Maybe developers push this in a later update)\\n\\nThere are two types of Graphs that can be generated using Mito:\\n\\n1. By tapping the graphs button\\n\\nYou will be presented with a sidebar menu to make the selections for the type of graph and the corresponding axes to be selected.\\n\\n2. By tapping the column name\\n\\nWhen you tap the column name from the spreadsheet, the filters and sorting options are visible. But if you navigate to ‚ÄúSummary Stats‚Äù, a line plot or bar plot, depending upon the type of variable is displayed along with the summary of the variable. This summary changes for text and no text variables.\\n\\nSave and Replay\\n\\nAll the transformations done on the dataset can be saved and used for other similar datasets. This takes the form of a macro or VBA in Excel. The same can be done via these functions too.\\n\\nScreenshot from Author notebook\\n\\nBacktracking all the Steps performed\\n\\nThis feature is the most interesting one. You can actually trace out all the transformations applied in the Mito-sheet. A list of all the operations is available with appropriate titles.\\n\\nAlso, you can view that particular step! This means that suppose you have changed some columns and then deleted them. You can step back to the time when it was not deleted.\\n\\nYou will also find this feature in Google‚Äôs Data Prep tool.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn this article, you got introduced to a new tool ‚ÄúMito‚Äù ‚Äì one-stop solution for implementing spreadsheet-like functions in a Python environment and getting the equivalent Python code for all the changes made. I explained how to install and debug the installation of Mito, all the features of this extension, and how to use them.\\n\\nIf you have any doubts, queries, or potential opportunities, then you can reach out to me via\\n\\n1.

This allows you to very quickly bounce back and forth between doing data analysis in Python and exploring/manipulating your data in the Mitosheet.\\n\\nBecause the Mitosheet is optimized for your Python data analysis, every tab inside of your Mitosheet represents a Pandas dataframe. To demonstrate this dataframe aspect, let‚Äôs take a look at displaying a single dataframe (of Tesla stock prices) in a Mitosheet:\\n\\nSee how to install Mito here.\\n\\nNote that the Mitosheet can also help you easily import your CSV and Excel files into dataframes with just the click of a button. You can see more about importing data into Mito.\\n\\nExploring your data in the Mitosheet\\n\\nUnlike just printing out a dataframe, Mito immediately allows you to see your entire data set. As you can see from the above screenshot, Mito makes it incredibly easy to:\\n\\nSee the column headers of your dataframe. Scroll through the rows of your dataframe and look for data points of interest. View the types of each of the columns in your dataframe. See the number of rows and colums in your dataframe.\\n\\nThere are a variety of more advanced ways to explore and understand your data, easily allowing you to access column summary statistics, graph your data, and more.\\n\\nEditing your data in the Mitosheet\\n\\nOn top of just allowing you to explore your data in a spreadsheet, the Mitosheet allows you to easily edit your data. You can find most of the basic actions in the toolbar at the top of the Mitosheet.\\n\\nIncluded actions allow you to edit columns in your dataframe, create pivot tables, merge multiple dataframes together, and much more.\\n\\nFurthermore, you can use the Action Search bar to search for any functionality that is included in the Mitosheet. If you‚Äôre not sure how to find some functionality in the Mitosheet, try searching for it!\\n\\nEditing columns in the sheet\\n\\nOne of the most basic operations you may perform in any spreadsheet is adding a column, and writing a spreadsheet formula. Let‚Äôs use the Mitosheet to calculate the Tesla stock price movement over each trading day.\\n\\nFirst, use the add column button to add a column to the dataset. Then, double click on the column header to edit it directly and rename it to Movement.\\n\\nfrom Author\\n\\nNow that we have a new column, we can write a formula inside of it! Simply:\\n\\nDouble click on a cell in the column Set the formula, referencing the other column headers by their name.\\n\\nfrom Author\\n\\nAfter pressing enter, we can see we‚Äôve easily calculated a new column in our dataframe, just like we would in a spreadsheet.\\n\\nfrom Author\\n\\nThe generated code\\n\\nFor each edit you make to the Mitosheet, Mito generates code below that corresponds to this edit. As you can see in the screenshot below, we‚Äôve added a column and set its formula, and the code that we generated does the very same:\\n\\nfrom Author\\n\\nRunning the generated code\\n\\nNow that you‚Äôve generated some code, you can run it! By running this generated code, you can lock in the changes you made to your dataframes in the Mitosheet (the edits you make in the mitosheet only apply to a copy of the dataframe by default). To use the edited dataframes in the rest of your analysis, just run the generated code, and keep writing Python below as you normally do!\\n\\nGenerated code and replaying an analysis\\n\\nWhen you make a mitosheet.sheet() call, Mito will automatically generate a analysis ID and write it as the analysis_to_replay parameter to this call. This analysis id will also appear in the generated code that Mito writes beneath the cell below - allowing the generated code and the mitosheet call to be linked together.\\n\\nAs long as you pass this analysis_to_replay parameter to the mitosheet.sheet() call, Mito will attempt to replay that analysis to the mitosheet. Replaying an analysis means applying the same edits that you did in Mito again. See below for an example.\\n\\nIf you want to start a fresh mitosheet, either make a new mitosheet.sheet() call or simply delete the analysis_to_replay parameter from an existing mitosheet call. Your generated code will remain below.\\n\\nAn example replaying analysis\\n\\nTo illustrate how replaying an analysis works works, consider the example above where we added a column to the Mitosheet, and set it‚Äôs formula. If we were to then:\\n\\nRerun the cell importing the tesla-stock.csv file as a dataframe. Rerun the cell rendering the mitosheet with mitosheet.sheet(tesla_stock, analysis_to_replay='id-abcdefg')\\n\\nThe mitosheet would add the Movement column to the dataframe, and set it's formula to Close - Open as in the previous analysis. This is because the generated code cell is right below the mitosheet.sheet call, and so Mito attempts to replay this analysis on the new dataframe that is passed (although the dataframe in this case happens to be identical).\"], ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox94C8-ebwQ', {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, ''], ['https://x.com/trymito?lang=en', {'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.0, 'pos': 0.0, 'compound': 0.0}, ''], ['https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32723766', {'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.844, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.9984}, \"Hiya HN, I'm Nate, cofounder of Mito ( https://trymito.io ) with my best friends Jake and Aaron. Mito is a spreadsheet UI that runs inside a Jupyter Notebook. Each time you edit the spreadsheet, it generates Python code for that edit. This allows analysts to write Python scripts using an interface they are familiar with, instead of waiting months for eng resources.\\n\\nMito is open core: http://github.com/mito-ds/monorepo. Our docs are at http://docs.trymito.io, and you can download it here: https://docs.trymito.io/getting-started/installing-mito.\\n\\nMost people doing data analysis in Python struggle to just write basic Python. If you search StackOverflow for the [pandas] tag, you‚Äôll find pandas users wrestling with everything from ‚Äúhow can I make a pivot table?‚Äù to ‚Äúhow do I import from another folder?‚Äù These users are experts in their field ‚Äî they just aren‚Äôt experts in Python. Tasks that take them seconds in spreadsheets can end up taking them days. (Here‚Äôs how we put it to investors: the next 10 million Python programmers are transitioning from Excel and have one real problem: writing the damn code.) A lot of organizations are stuck on this dilemma: they want to move from spreadsheets to Python, but getting started with programming‚Äîeven with a highly usable language like Python‚Äîis hard.\\n\\nWe‚Äôve spent years with users trying to adapt their spreadsheet skills to Python. It takes weeks to learn the basics. Their existing skills don't transfer. Many of their needs are simple to do in a spreadsheet‚Äîwriting a formula, aggregating data, graphing‚Äîbut adapting them to Python requires long courses, emails to internal support (if any exists) waiting days for a reply, and countless trips to Stack Overflow. Often they just give up and return to Excel, but that makes them dependent on IT to write code for them. One of our users was quoted a full year for IT to implement a simple report! (Fast-forward: he ended up using Mito to automate it himself in less than a week.)\\n\\nWe went through this ourselves when we went to college together, studying engineering and business. We first learned data science with spreadsheets, then had to relearn it in Python. The transition was painful‚Äîbasic Excel was much easier! Of course, not-so-basic Excel soon becomes not-so-easy, which is what drives the move to Python in the first place.\\n\\nWith our interest in spreadsheets, we started a spreadsheet-version-control company at the end of college, and spent a year working with Excel power users. Eventually, we realized that version control was secondary to the real problems users faced with spreadsheets: limited data size, speed limits, lack of advanced functionality, and a horrible replayability story.\\n\\nEssentially, enterprises are caught between a rock (their spreadsheet woes) and a hard place (the pain of moving analysts to Python). We decided to work on this instead, and started Mito.\\n\\nMito is a spreadsheet UI built as an extension to Jupyter Notebooks / JupyterLab. Using a Mito spreadsheet, users can import data, add and delete columns, write formulas like Excel, make pivot tables, generate graphs, and more. See our docs (http://docs.trymito.io) for all our functionality.\\n\\nEvery tab in a Mito spreadsheet is a different pandas DataFrame. For each edit made, a line of pandas code is generated in a code cell directly below the spreadsheet that corresponds to this edit. For example, if I use Mito to import a CSV, add a column named Day of Week, and use the WEEKDAY formula from Excel to pull out the weekday from another column, Mito generates the following code:\\n\\n# Imported tesla stock.csv import pandas as pd tesla_stock = pd.read_csv(r'tesla stock.csv') # Added column Day of week tesla_stock.insert(1, 'Day of week', WEEKDAY(tesla_stock['Date']))\\n\\nIn practice, the typical user bounces back and forth between writing Python and using the Mito spreadsheet, depending on the task at hand. We think this fluid movement between a spreadsheet and Python is really cool. The spreadsheet backend is just a Python extension to the IPython kernel you‚Äôre already running for your Jupyter Notebook. Because Mito is just a Python package, all data processing happens locally.\\n\\nAs mentioned, Mito is an open core product. 90% of the code is AGPL licensed. The rest is under a separate enterprise license. These modules are still source-visible, but require users to pay for a pro or enterprise offering before using them. That‚Äôs basically our business model.\\n\\nWe have 3 versions (https://trymito.io/plans): (1) Free: basic analysis tools, as well as some basic telemetry that you can opt out of; (2). Pro: all of (1), with advanced functionality; (3) Enterprise: all of (2), with more advanced features, optimizations, and support.\\n\\nBecause spreadsheets are sprawling pieces of software, we‚Äôre pretty obsessed with optimizing for long-term development. We use strong types where we can (TypeScript on the frontend, fairly comprehensive MyPy in Python). We‚Äôve implemented our own component libraries for common components from scratch, which lets us be flexible during large refactorings. We implemented our own custom JavaScript grid‚Äîhyper-optimized for our use case, and as a result is the fastest JS grid we tested in our context. We're also big fans of metaprogramming‚Äîwe write an increasing amount of code that writes code for us‚Äîwhich in turn makes it easy to add more functionality to our spreadsheet.\\n\\nWe posted about Mito a long time ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24305615. No one really liked it (we learned our lesson!), and it didn't do much at the time ‚Äî I think the app had a single button that added a column. Three months ago, someone (not sure who ‚Äî thank you, alefnula!) posted it again: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31446236. It reached the top 3 and we got lots of comments‚Äîyay! Since then, we‚Äôve doubled the number of features (mostly data processing), done a UI overhaul, dramatically expanded the Pro + Enterprise offering, made telemetry optional in the free version, and more.\\n\\nWe‚Äôd love to hear all about your experiences with spreadsheet analysis, the uncanny valley between spreadsheets and code, the travails of moving enterprise analytics off of spreadsheets, and whatever else you‚Äôd like to ask or mention.

Their interface provides the users with a certain comfort. But with respect to the increase in the quantity of data to analyze, spreadsheets tend to lose their power because of their slowness which can be frustrating and time-consuming.\\n\\nHere comes Mito ,a tool that tries to bridge this gap by combining the advantages of spreadsheets with the speed of execution in order to improve the user experience.\\n\\nIn this article article, we will understand what mito is, and walk you through some features it provides.\\n\\nWhat is Mito?\\n\\nmito is an open-source tool for data analysis, developed by Jacob Diamond-Reivich. It is essentially like excel spreadsheets but used to speed up your python analysis 10x faster. With mito , you can easily explore your dataset in mitosheet which is the interface provided by mito for data analysis.\\n\\nIn addition to the previous benefits, wouldn‚Äôt be also nice to automatically get the python source code corresponding to the edits performed on the interface, and export the final result of your analysis on your own machine. These are some of the benefits of mito!\\n\\nLet‚Äôs get things straight by starting with the requirements, consisting of installing mitosheet package with the following pip instruction from your terminal\\n\\npython -m pip install mitoinstaller python -m mitoinstaller install\\n\\nor from your Jupyterlab notebook.\\n\\n!pip install mitosheet\\n\\nNote: make sure to restart your kernel so that all the modifications are taken into consideration.\\n\\nOnce the installation is performed, you should be able to import the library using the following syntax.\\n\\n# Import the library import mitosheet\\n\\nGet Started\\n\\nWe will illustrate the use of mitosheet from examples using the adult income data set which is license-free available on Kaggle.\\n\\nNow that all the requirements are satisfied, we are ready to ride on the shoulder of the giant! The whole magic happens from the mitosheet user interface that we can get with this simple command\\n\\n# Show the User Interface mitosheet.sheet()\\n\\nFrom the previous instruction, we get the following interface from which the user can easily import its file which is either a CSV or Excel file.\\n\\nWe can notice that all the tabs are self-explanatory, for instance, UNDO used to undo an action, REDO, which is the opposite of the previous one. CLEAR to delete all the actions we performed, IMPORT, to import a data set, EXPORT to export a data set, etc.\\n\\nMitosheet Main Interface (Image from Author)\\n\\nGet the Data\\n\\nWe can import the data either by using the + sign in the bottom left or the IMPORT tab at the top.\\n\\nData Importation Steps (Image by Author)\\n\\nAfter selecting the data to import from the previous steps (+ sign and Import adults_income_data.csv), we get the following interface showing the data, the types of each column under the name of the columns. For instance, workclass is a string (str). At the bottom right of the same interface, we can observe the number of rows (32 561) and columns (15).\\n\\nDefault Interface after data importation (Image by Author)\\n\\nAt the end of each process, the corresponding python code is generated along with the comments as the one above for data importation (same code below).\\n\\nStart the Analysis\\n\\nMitosheet proposes different possibilities of analysis that can be relevant in the day-to-day activities of Data Analysts. Some of those analyses include generating summary statistics, merging datasets, column deduplication, deletions, etc. You can find the exhaustive list of the possibilities here.\\n\\nIn this section, we will mainly focus on the first two possibilities, illustrating each one using our dataset as introduced in the Getting started section. At the end of the analysis, the final data set will be saved and exported with a different name.\\n\\nSummary Statistics\\n\\nMitosheet by default shows a histogram of the frequency of values in the column, along with the output of the [describe()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html) function from pandas for more advanced statistical information.\\n\\nThe general syntax of getting the statistics is in three main steps: Select column > filter icon > Summary Stats. We ** can apply the same approach to the ag**e column, as shown below.\\n\\nProcess for getting statistics of the age column (Image by Author)\\n\\nAfter selecting the Summary Stats button, the following result is automatically generated on the right side of the table. Since the information is not that visible on the screenshot, I decided to display the full statistical information below: age distribution and the corresponding summary statistics. A similar result can be generated for all the continuous features in the data set.\\n\\nResult of the Summary Stats for the Age column (Image by Author)\\n\\nThe following result is what we get for the education column which is a categorical column. Also, a similar result can be found for all the categorical features in the data set.\\n\\nResult of the Summary Stats for the Education column (Image by Author)\\n\\nMerging datasets\\n\\nmitosheet ‚Äòs MERGE module is used to merge different data sets together. This feature provides five mainly used merging possibilities shown below.\\n\\nlookup merge : it includes all the observations from the first sheet and only matching rows from the second one. In the case of multiple matching in the second sheet, only the first is considered.\\n\\n: it includes all the observations from the first sheet and only matching rows from the second one. In the case of multiple matching in the second sheet, only the first is considered. inner join : it only includes rows with matches in both sheets.\\n\\n: it only includes rows with matches in both sheets. outer join : this one includes all the rows from both sheets, regardless of whether there is a match in the other sheet.\\n\\n: this one includes all the rows from both sheets, regardless of whether there is a match in the other sheet. left join : includes all the rows from the first sheet and only matching rows from the second sheet.\\n\\n: includes all the rows from the first sheet and only matching rows from the second sheet. right join: as opposed to the previous one, it includes all the rows from the second sheet and only matching rows from the first sheet.\\n\\nFor instance, I created from the original dataset a new dataset called adult_identifier.csv (with only age, education, sex, and native.country columns and 3000 random observations). This second data set is merged with the first one using the lookup merge based on the native.country column. The process can be performed using mitosheet as follow:\\n\\nFrom the first section\\n\\n1. Import the second data similarly to the first one.\\n\\n2. Choose the MERGE tab, which automatically creates a new data set (df3) to be the result of the merge. The second section is also automatically displayed to allow the user to implement the merge logic.\\n\\nFrom the first section\\n\\nThis section implements the logic of merging the two datasets. It requires the user to choose the merge type corresponding to one of the five possibilities explained previously. Then, the user can choose the first sheet, the second sheet, and the columns to keep from both sheets.\\n\\nMerging Interface (Image by Author)\\n\\nAfter completing the merge logic, close the Merge Sheets Together section by hitting the X sign on the right to automatically generate the content of the df3. The following Python code is also generated at the end of the process.\\n\\nRename Final data and Export\\n\\nWhen we are done and happy with our final analysis, we might want to export the result for further action. Since df3 is not a self-explanatory name, we can change the name (final_adult_income in our case) as shown below.\\n\\nChange final data name (Image by Author)\\n\\nAfter that, we can export the data as either a CSV or excel file as follow.\\n\\nSelect the file and choose EXPORT tab at the top which automatically opens the download section on the right. From there, we can choose the format of the file (CSV in this case), then select Download CSV file to conclude the process.\\n\\nExporting process of the final data in the CSV format (Image by Author)\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nCongratulations! üéâ üçæ You have just learned how to speed up your data analysis process with mitosheet !

With increasing amount of data and the various data analytics processes, Excel might no longer be the best tool for the job. Of course, one of the best alternatives is using Python together with the NumPy and Pandas libraries. However, getting the Excel diehards to switch over to Pandas overnight might not be an easy tasks. This is where Mito comes in.\\n\\nMito is an open-source data analytics tool that allows you to manipulate your data using a spreadsheet and then automatically generating the steps in Python. Using Mito, an Excel user can load up his dataset as a spreadsheet and then perform all the data analytics task using Mito‚Äôs built-in graphical user interface. When all is done, Mito will generate all the Python code so that the user can use it to perform other tasks, such as expose them as REST APIs, build machine learning models, and more.\\n\\nMito is developed by Jacob Diamond-Reivich.\\n\\nFor this article, I will walk you through some of the common data analytics tasks that you‚Ä¶'], ['https://blog.dailydoseofds.com/p/build-elegant-data-apps-with-the', {'neg': 0.037, 'neu': 0.769, 'pos': 0.193, 'compound': 0.9962}, 'Personally, I am a big fan of no-code data analysis tools.
